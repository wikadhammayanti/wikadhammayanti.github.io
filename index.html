                <p>I'm a naturally curious and driven individual with a background in education and customer service as a Guest Service Executive in the hotel industry. But these days, I'm super excited to pursue my passion for data analysis as a career! With my recent completion of the Google Analytics Professional Certificate and further training in data analysis, I've developed a solid foundation in data analysis tools and techniques. I love using data to tell stories and uncover hidden insights that can help organizations succeed. As a former teacher, I've honed my critical thinking and analytical skills, as well as my ability to work with data sets and derive insight from them. Plus, my experience in customer service has given me excellent communication and collaboration skills. I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I can't wait to apply my skills and experience to a data analyst role. Thanks for stopping by, and let's connect soon!</p>

                                        This report describes a SQL query that was used to retrieve total sales data for users in a flight dataset, 
                                with a filter applied to identify users with sales that decreased by a certain amount each year.
                                
                                The query was constructed using several clauses, including SELECT, FROM, INNER JOIN, GROUP BY, and HAVING. 
                                The SELECT clause was used to retrieve the user ID and name, as well as the total sales data for each year from 2020 to 2023. 
                                The FROM clause specified the flight dataset table, and the INNER JOIN clause was used to join the user dataset table to retrieve user names. 
                                The GROUP BY clause was used to group the data by user ID and name. 
                                Finally, the HAVING clause was used to filter the data to identify users with sales that decreased by at least 10,000 each year.
                                
                                The query returned a list of users who met the specified criteria, along with their total sales data for each year. 
                                The list was ordered by user ID.
                                
                                Based on the results of this query, it is recommended that further investigation be conducted into the sales trends for the users identified by the filter. 
                                This may involve examining factors such as pricing, competition, and customer behavior to determine the cause of the sales decrease. 
                                It may also be helpful to conduct additional queries or analyses to gain more insight into the data.
                                
                                In conclusion, the SQL query described in this report was used to retrieve total sales data for users in a flight dataset, 
                                with a filter applied to identify users with sales that decreased by a certain amount each year. 
                                The results of the query can be used to inform further analysis and decision-making related to the sales trends for these users.

                                        The data analysis revealed that there is a weak positive correlation between salary and performance score, 
                                        indicating that as the salary increases, there is a slight increase in performance score. 
                                        However, the scatter plot showed heteroscedasticity, suggesting that the results may be unreliable for prediction.
                                        
                                        Further analysis showed that there is a gender-based performance difference in employees that varies by marital status. 
                                        On average, female employees have a higher performance score compared to male employees. However, for married employees, 
                                        divorced employees, and widowed employees, the average performance score is higher for males than females. 
                                        For separated employees, the average performance score is higher for males than females. For single employees, 
                                        the average performance score is higher for females than males. 
                                        These findings suggest that there may be certain factors associated with marital status that could influence 
                                        the performance of employees differently based on their gender.
                                        
                                        Based on these findings, it is recommended that the company investigate and understand these factors to potentially reduce any biases 
                                        and ensure a fair and equal working environment for all employees. 
                                        Additionally, the company should focus on optimizing their recruitment strategy to attract high-quality candidates. 
                                        LinkedIn and Google search were identified as the top two sources for attracting top talent, 
                                        and the company can consider investing more in these sources. The company can also encourage employee referrals 
                                        and increase the referral bonus to attract more high-quality referrals. 
                                        Finally, attending more diversity job fairs can increase the pool of diverse candidates for the company.

                                        We can see that Fiction book is 44% and Non Fiction is 56%. From 2009 to 2019 the review is increased. The highest number of people to give a good rating from 4.5 to 4.9 is in the Non Fiction book. In each year the produced of Non Fiction book is higher than Fiction book. And there is no linear relationship between price and rating, means that higher price does not result higher rating in Fiction and Non Fiction book.
